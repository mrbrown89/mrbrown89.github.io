ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Matt

Iâ€™m an IT professional working in the world of animation â€” where creative pipelines meet rock-solid infrastructure.

This site is a place for me to document, share and reflect on the tech challenges and solutions I encounter while supporting a busy animation studio.

From Apple devices and Jamf management to backups, render nodes, SaltStack, and switches â€” if it helps pixels land on screen, and automation makes it smoother, then itâ€™s my jam!
